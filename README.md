# conversational-search-app
The application provides a RESTful API that allows clients to upload files (pdf, csv, txt), generates a conversational retrieval model using LangChain and OpenAI, and performs searches on the generated model. It combines file text processing, vectorization, and a conversational retrieval chain to facilitate intelligent question-answering capabilities.
